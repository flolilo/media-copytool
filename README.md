# Media-Copytool - develpment branch
**This branch is for active development. At the moment, there might be things broken. If you want to use the script, please go back to the Master branch. As soon as this branch is working properly, it will be merged.**

Media-Copytool is my attempt to create a tool to easily (and switfly) copies files from my DSLR's memory-cards to my computer. Its feature-set now beats most (if not all) professional RAW-converters (except of course in converting RAWs ;-) ). And the fun doesn't end here - there are even more features to come! And best of all: it not only works with your camera, but with all files that you have! (Also, it's free.)

**Bug-reports, questions, and feature-requests would be very much appreciated!**
