# Media-Copytool

Media-Copytool is my attempt to create a tool to easily (and switfly) copies files from my DSLR's memory-cards to my computer. Its feature-set now beats most (if not all) professional RAW-converters (except of course in converting RAWs ;-) ). And the fun doesn't end here - there are even more features to come! And best of all: it not only works with your camera, but with all files that you have! (Also, it's free.)

**Bug-reports, questions, and feature-requests would be very much appreciated!**
