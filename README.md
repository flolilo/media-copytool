# media-copytool
PowerShell-based, GUI-including script that not only copies your files, but also verifies them afterwards.

## Prerequisites
At the moment: Windows. PowerShell v3+ is needed for the script, Robocopy and Xcopy (both included in Windows >= XP) are used for copying.
To run the GUI, .Net Framework 4.6+ is needed. (The script will tell you need it.)

## Installing
* [Download the zip](https://github.com/flolilo/media-copytool/archive/master.zip)
* Extract files to a folder
* Start the script.

### Troubleshooting
If you cannot start the script:
* Check if PowerShell's `Set-ExecutionPolicy` [is set correctly](https://superuser.com/a/106363/703240),
* Check if prerequisites are met.

## Readme
:uk: :us: I recommend using the readme-file `README.rtf` (fill in * according to the version you are using) or using `Get-Help .\media_copytool.ps1 -detailed` in PowerShell - as of now, I still have to get used to GitHub's styling (and its limitations for a complete readme). :us: :uk:

:de: Die Readme-Datei hat auch einen deutschsprachigen Teil (anders als der Befehl `Get-Help .\media_copytool.ps1 -detailed`). :de:

## To do
