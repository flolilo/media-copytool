Todo:
    [ ] Create a all-round Pester-script @high
    [ ] Make sure that only allowed names are used for files & folders.
        [ ] https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx & https://cosmoskey.blogspot.co.at/2009/09/powershell-function-convert.html @critical
    [ ] Check impact of file buffering through `Copy-LongItem` and `Write-FileSystemCache` @low
    [ ] Add support for multiple input-folders, especially for `AvoidIdenticalFiles`?
    [ ] Create GUI in C#, call CLI-only, param-only PoSh-script with it (i.e. `media-copytool.exe` opens GUI, then passes values to `media-copytool.ps1`)
        [ ] Separate GUI from rest of the script: GUI starts script with parameters. (2nd script) @high
    [ ] trying a custom implementation of [`RSJob`](https://github.com/proxb/PoshRSJob) with [`Write-ProgressEx`](https://github.com/mazzy-ax/Write-ProgressEx) (if it isn't too heavy on performance) @low
    [ ] test [`PSThreadJob`](https://github.com/PaulHigin/PSThreadJob) performance. @low
    [ ] Deutsche Ãœbersetzung (sinnvollerweise erst mit Message-Variablen, daher in weiter Ferne) @low
To test (for bugs/regresses):
    [ ] look for alternative to xcopy (e.g. `Copy-LongItem` and `Write-FileSystemCache`)
    [ ] Maybe recall `$Debug` to something like `$InfoPreference`? @low
    [ ] Option to ignore 3 seconds in difference in `LastWriteTime` (i.e. different cards with same files)
        [ ] Go for UNIX-Times? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10781697/convert-unix-time-with-powershell
    [ ] History-File: Go for `N`, `D`, `S`, `H` for field names
    [ ] Delete interactive mode. @low
        [ ] Rename `-GUI_CLI_direct`.
    [ ] Allow `y`/`n` and `yes`/`no` as answers (instead/additional to `1`/`0`).
    [-] Remove zipping mirror option (too complicated to maintain) @low @cancelled(18-05-07 16:45)
        [ ] Cross it out, but leave it there, as it may be revived again later on.
    [ ] implement `%foo%` instead of `yyyy-mm-dd`-stuff.
        [ ] Create a prefix-/suffix-option for renaming both subfolders and files.
        [ ] for this, sorting the files by name will be in order.
    [ ] remove preset-formats and change system to all/only/except.
    [ ] (mainly) use `throw` instead of `return $false` for errors inside the script.
    [ ] Separate GUI from rest of the script: GUI starts script with parameters. (same script) @high
